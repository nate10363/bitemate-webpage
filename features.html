                <h2 class="feature-title">Main Feed</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">View the most recent recipe and non-recipe posts from all following accounts on this social media feed!  We don't try to control the media that you see, so your friends' posts won't be blocked out in favor of some random meme or entertainment type post.  From here, you'll be able to share posts, get a recipe recommendation, explore all the cuisines of the world, go to the chat screen, save videos, and much more!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-child">
                <h2 class="feature-title">Explore Pages</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">Our favorite part of the app, clicking the explore pages icon at the bottom of the screen brings you to a toggle globe where you can randomly or purposefully choose which country's feed to enter.  You'll be able to see recipe posts specifically from this country, while navigating the different content creators that service whichever country and culture about which you desire to learn!  Subscribe to them to view their premium content :) if you're looking for a specific country but are not sure where it's located, you'll be able to open a list of all countries and select by name from an alphabetically ordered list</p>

            <div class="flex-child">
                <h2 class="feature-title">Recipe Search</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">Hosting an unimaginable amount of recipes, we want you to be able to navigate bringing the excitement to your own life with accuracy and efficiency.  Go to the bottom navigation bar and select the Recipe Search option to specify your recipe search filters with dozens of options, including a country specification from the toggle globe!  Foreshadowing to the Edit Filters option, you'll be able to save different lists of filters, choose one of those filters to be applied to your recipe search, and add different tags on top of that list.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-child">
                <h2 class="feature-title">Recipe Recommendations</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">We can't contain our excitement about this globalization trend that we're setting as much as you can't, so we developed this Recipe Recommendations screen.  It works similarly to a Secret Santa drawing.  Essentially, users can decide to recommend a recipe (by recommending an entire recipe post), which places that recipe into a hat with all of its filters still applied.  When a user goes to have a recipe recommended, they apply all of the filters that they want, including one of their preset lists, which will churn out a matching recipe from the hat.  You'll be able to see the user that recommended the recipe, and maybe you should even follow them to let them know how it goes.  The same toggle globe from the Explore pages will be available, so make sure to use it recklessly :)</p>

            <div class="flex-child">
                <h2 class="feature-title">User Profile</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">Setting your profile picture is cool, but use the Favorite Food photo to flex to everyone that you live above the generic pizza or sushi bias.  Display a sponsorship from a company, filter through your past posts, view your followers, and more :) Edit this information, as well as your subscription price, by clicking on the Edit button at the top right of your profile screen.  Set your country via the edit page and your proud flag will be shown on your profile, which will be hyperlinked to that country's explore page :) We all win when the family doesn't feud but instead boasts their present and/or ancestral heritage :)</p>

                <h2 class="feature-title">Subscriptions and Recipe Purchases</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">The foodie space is one of the top niches in the entire internet ecosystem with the top user engagement per post ratio.  There are hundreds, maybe even thousands, of content creators that dream every day of living their dreams of manifesting their creativities, cultural experiences, and expertises through their recipes.  Supporting these creators through subscriptions and recipe purchases allows them to dedicate more of their time to bringing that new spice into our lives every day.  We at Bitemate want to see this platform-wide creativity flourish just as much as you, so we try our best not to take any revenue away from creators, while also trying to find other ways to financially supplement their potential long term careers.  To learn how to subscribe to a user or purchase one of their recipes, visit the FAQ page</p>

                <h2 class="feature-title">Sponsorships</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">Each user whether they post homegrown recipes or not can decide to accept a sponsorship from a company.  We've integrated our own bidding system API into the platform to allow users to view these bids, accept or decline a bid, interact with other users (where companies would also be considered users) and negotiate, etc.  Users are free to accept a bid for any reason or price even if it is not the highest priced bid.  Of course these are all optional.  If a user does not accept a bid for any certain month, they can decide to upload any other photo of their choosing</p>

            <div class="flex-child">
                <h2 class="feature-title">Creating Posts</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">At the moment, we offer two post types: recipe and regular.  Recipe posts contain all of the different filters that we offer.  One can choose a recipe post to be free, private, or premium.  See the FAQ page to learn more.  Regular posts are more for typical social media style posts where one can add a photo, comment, tag the post with a country from the toggle globe, and more.  Media files are required on all posts</p>

            <div class="flex-child">
                <h2 class="feature-title">Recipe of the Day</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">We crave content creators that continuously push their bounds of culinary culture through their recipes, and we want to reward that as much as possible.  The recipe of the day will be selected without regards to how many followers or subscribers a user has or any other popularity contest, nor will we be paid or influenced in any way.  We just want to nourish a community that increasingly becomes more globally aware of the different cuisines that the thousands of different peoples have to offer :)</p>

                <h2 class="feature-title">Cooking Skills and Vegan Replacements</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">Cooking is hard and no one ever tells you how to do things the safe and efficient way.  These two sections are just devoted to be easy access learning opportunities ranging from learning to cut an onion to seasoning your cast iron skillet to replacing eggs or butter with vegan substitutes.</p><br>
                <p class="feature-description">Have skill or vegan replacement recommendations, or even videos of your own skills, that you want added or featured?!

                <h2 class="feature-title">Edit Filter Lists and Top Button</h2>
                <p class="feature-description">Sometimes your favorite food is lasagna and sometimes you want to burn lasagna with jet fuel.  We get that.  A Filters List is simply a list of different filters, such as fat free + spinach + avoid cilantro + Germany.  The Edit Filters Lists option is a bank of all of the lists that a user has created and saved.  The user can use these lists to easily apply filtering criteria to the Recipe Search and Recipe Recommendations screen.  More so, at the top of the Main Feed and Explore pages screens is a toggle button where users can select a preset Filters List and filter all posts on these pages according to these specifications.  By using this button, we place the filtering powers and viewing experience in the hands of the users, rather than in the hands of an algorithm that dictates your entire viewing experience.  Sometimes you just want to burn an algorithm with jet fuel, and we get that, too</p>

The description in this item is actually a pretty good option.  You can also view posts that you purchased or were tagged in from this same tab, but who really cares what your "friend" is sending if it isn't the newest birria taco infused taki mac and cheese that made you throw up last night anyways</p>
